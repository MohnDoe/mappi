The point of this is to simulate as accurately as possible a booster opening using data such as [taw/magic-sealed-data](https://github.com/taw/magic-sealed-data) and MTGJSON

### Things to do before "release"
- [ ] Return rates for each set
      - With global and local rates
- [ ] Return more than just the card UUID
- [ ] Write test to pit the booster opening algorithm against the set's rates
      - IDK, maybe simulate opening a pack 10,000x and then check the actual rates of each card against the rate of the set
- [ ] Create a cool front-end
- [ ] Deploy it somewhere (free)
- [ ] Save users' opening
- [x] Have fun doing so
